# decode.py
Python script for decoding Base64, Url Encoding and ROT encoding.  

Switches can be used to decode a string (must use quotes if there are spaces in the string) as follows:

-b base64
-u url decode
-r ROT decode

If no switch is supplied the script will attempt to guess the encoding type based on character-set and some math and will decode accordingly.

-h help screen
